Here's why:  * **Limited Pixels:** There are only a handful of pixels (3-4) that deviate from the purple background, indicating a very limited area of active fire. * **Pixel Size:** Each pixel represents a relatively small area (375m x 375m). Even if those few pixels were clustered together, it wouldn't constitute a 'Medium' or 'Large' fire.  **Estimate of Active Fire Pixels:** 3-4 "
