Here's why:  * **No Active Fires:** The most important image shows no current active fires in the area.  * **Lack of Ignition Source:** Without existing fires, a new wildfire requires an ignition source. While the images provide weather conditions, they don't reveal potential ignition sources like lightning strikes or human activity.  * **Moderate Weather:** While the images indicate relatively warm temperatures and low precipitation (increasing the risk of fire spread IF a fire were to start), the wind speeds are not excessively high. This means that even if a fire were to ignite, the likelihood of it rapidly spreading and becoming a major concern is lower.  **Important Note:** This assessment is based solely on the provided images and lacks crucial context. In a real-world scenario, additional factors are essential for accurate fire prediction:  * **Fuel Type and Moisture:** The type and dryness of vegetation significantly influence fire risk.  * **Topography:** Steep slopes can accelerate fire spread. * **Recent Weather Patterns:** Prolonged drought drastically increases fire danger.  * **Human Activity:**  Human actions are a major cause of wildfires.  **Therefore, while these images suggest a lower likelihood of new fire activity, it's crucial to consult comprehensive fire danger assessments and local authorities for accurate and up-to-date information.** ","No New Active Fire  **Reasoning:**  While we don't have information about weather conditions (like wind and humidity) which are critical for wildfire risk, here's why I lean towards ""No New Active Fire"" based on the provided images:  * **No Current Fires:** The ""current active fires"" image is entirely purple, indicating no active fires in the area. This is the most important factor. Without an existing fire, a new ignition source is needed. * **Terrain and Elevation:**       * The slopes in the region are relatively gentle (most of the ""slope"" image is purplish-blue), meaning fire wouldn't spread as rapidly uphill.      * The ""elevation"" image shows a range, but without more context (general climate of the area), it's hard to determine fuel dryness solely from elevation.  **Important Considerations (Missing Information):**  * **Weather is Key:**  Wildfire risk is heavily influenced by:     * **Wind:** Strong winds can quickly spread fires, even in areas with moderate terrain.     * **Humidity:** Low humidity dries out fuels, making them easier to ignite.      * **Recent Precipitation:** A lack of recent rain increases fire risk. * **Fuel Type:** The type of vegetation (grass, shrubs, trees) significantly impacts fire behavior. Dry, easily ignitable fuels pose a higher risk. * **Human Activity:** Many wildfires are human-caused. Information on nearby populations or activities would be relevant.  **In Conclusion:** Based purely on the terrain, elevation, and the absence of current fires, a new wildfire is less likely. However, comprehensive wildfire risk assessment requires weather data, fuel information, and human factors. ","No New Active Fire  Here's my reasoning:  * **No Current Fires:** The most important factor is the lack of currently active fires. New fires typically ignite from existing ones or require specific conditions like lightning strikes.  * **Wind:** While wind speed is a factor in fire spread, it alone doesn't ignite a fire. The wind direction map doesn't show a significant concentration in a particular area, which would be concerning if an active fire existed. * **Moisture:** The forecast total precipitation map indicates some areas will receive a fair amount of rain (yellow). This suggests reduced fire risk due to increased fuel moisture. While not all areas will receive rain, the specific humidity map doesn't show extremely low values (deep purple), indicating it's unlikely to be critically dry. * **Temperature:** Temperatures aren't excessively high (no intensely bright yellows). While warmer temperatures contribute to dryness, they are less likely to cause a fire without other contributing factors.   **In conclusion:** The absence of current fires, combined with the forecast of some precipitation and relatively moderate conditions in other factors, makes a new active fire unlikely in this scenario.

However, without additional information about weather conditions (wind, temperature, humidity) and fuel availability, it's impossible to say with certainty that the fire will be completely extinguished by the next day.  3. **Conservative Estimate:** Given the recent detection and lack of comprehensive data to guarantee complete extinction, a *smaller active fire* is the more probable and cautious prediction. This acknowledges the possibility of some residual fire activity while also considering the likelihood of reduced intensity. ","Smaller Active Fire   Here's why:  * **Current Active Fire:** The image shows a small, recent active fire (indicated by the bright yellow).  * **Forecast Wind Speed:** While not extremely high, the wind speeds in the area of the fire are not negligible (mid-range green to blue). This suggests the potential for some spread. * **Forecast Wind Direction:** The wind direction (hard to determine from the low resolution but appears to be blowing from the purple/blue area towards the yellow) could push the fire slightly. * **Forecast Precipitation:** The near-absence of purple in the precipitation forecast indicates little to no rain is expected, meaning it won't help suppress the fire. * **Forecast Temperature and Humidity:**  High temperatures (yellows and greens) combined with relatively low specific humidity (mostly dark colors) create prime conditions for fire to continue burning.  **Conclusion:** While the existing fire is small, the combination of wind, lack of rain, and favorable temperature/humidity conditions suggests it will likely continue to burn, though not necessarily spread drastically.

This suggests a relatively small fire at present.  2. **VIIRS Band M11:**  This band detects heat. While it shows some slightly elevated temperatures (greenish-yellow), the overall picture is relatively cool (predominantly blue/purple). This suggests the current fire is not massively intense yet.  3. **Fuel Availability (NDVI, EVI2, Landcover):** The NDVI and EVI2 images show generally healthy vegetation (greens and yellows). This indicates there is potential fuel available if the fire were to spread. The landcover image helps confirm the presence of burnable vegetation types.  4. **Drought Conditions (PDSI):** The PDSI image shows a moderate to severe drought (yellows and greens).  Drought conditions significantly increase the risk of fire spread and intensity, as vegetation is drier and more flammable.  5. **Energy Release Component (ERC):** The ERC image shows moderate to high values (greens and yellows).  This means the available fuel in the area has the potential for significant energy release if ignited, contributing to fire intensity.   **Conclusion:**  While the current fire appears small, the presence of ample fuel, drought conditions, and a moderate to high energy release component suggest a high likelihood of the fire growing larger on the next day. ","Smaller Active Fire  **Reasoning:**  1. **Current Active Fires:** We see a very small number of pixels representing active fires on the current day, indicating a small fire.  2. **Total Precipitation:** The total precipitation image shows a significant amount of rain (greenish-yellow) in the area, especially where the active fire is currently located. This suggests a high likelihood of the rain suppressing the fire.   3. **Wind Conditions:** While wind can exacerbate fire spread, the wind speeds are relatively moderate (not excessively yellow). Additionally, the lack of any clear directional trend in the wind direction image suggests wind is unlikely to be a dominant factor in the fire's growth.  4. **Humidity and Temperature:** Although the specific humidity isn't particularly high, the significant precipitation makes it less of a concern. Temperatures are also not extremely high, further reducing the risk of rapid fire growth.  **Conclusion:**  Considering the very small size of the current fire and the significant amount of rain predicted right over the fire's location, it is highly probable that the fire will be significantly smaller or even extinguished by the next day.  ","Larger Active Fire   **Reasoning:**  While there is only a single, small fire detected in the ""Current Active Fires"" image, the surrounding terrain and its characteristics suggest a high likelihood of fire spread:  * **Slope:** The fire appears located in an area of generally moderate slope, but with noticeable steeper sections nearby (indicated by the yellowish hues).  Fires spread more rapidly uphill. * **Aspect:**  Without knowing the precise geographical location and therefore the orientation of north/south, it's impossible to determine the prevailing aspect. However, aspect plays a role in sun exposure and fuel dryness. If the slopes around the fire are south-facing (in the Northern Hemisphere), that would contribute to faster fire spread. * **Elevation:** Elevation alone doesn't tell us much about spread, but it can be a factor in conjunction with other elements (e.g., vegetation type at that elevation).   **Important Considerations:**  * **Wind:**  Wind is a crucial factor in wildfire behavior, and we have no wind information in this scenario. Wind can drastically influence both speed and direction of spread, overriding the influence of slope and aspect.  * **Fuel Type:** The type and condition of fuel (vegetation) is a major determinant of how readily a fire will spread. We have no data on this. Dry, easily flammable fuels will contribute to rapid spread. * **Fire Suppression:** It's impossible to predict the impact of firefighting efforts. Active suppression efforts can significantly limit fire growth.  **In Conclusion:** Based solely on the limited terrain data and the presence of an active, albeit small, fire, the most probable outcome is **Larger Active Fire**. However, this assessment is missing critical information about wind, fuels, and firefighting efforts that could significantly alter the outcome. ","Larger Active Fire  **Reasoning:**  1. **Current Fire:** We see a small, single-pixel fire in the current active fire image. This indicates a very recent ignition or a small, potentially contained fire.  2. **Wind:** The forecast wind speed image shows moderate wind speeds in the area surrounding the existing fire.  More importantly, the wind direction map indicates wind blowing from the west, pushing any potential spread eastward.  3. **Fuel and Weather:** The absence of forecast precipitation suggests dry conditions will persist. Additionally, the forecast temperature map shows a warm to hot day ahead, further drying out potential fuels.    4. **Humidity:**  Specific humidity, while generally on the lower end, is not excessively low, suggesting some moisture in the air. However, this is unlikely to counteract the wind and temperature influences.  **Conclusion:**  The combination of an active fire, even a small one, with moderate wind speeds pushing towards dry fuels under warm temperatures, suggests a high probability of the fire increasing in size.

Drier fuels ignite and burn more readily. Unfortunately, we don't have direct information on fuel moisture levels in these images.  4. **Forecast Precipitation:** The forecast total precipitation map shows very low precipitation (indicated by mostly dark colors). This suggests dry conditions will persist, potentially drying out fuels further.  5. **Forecast Humidity:** The forecast specific humidity map also shows relatively low values (again, indicated by darker colors).  Low humidity corresponds with drier air, further increasing the risk of fire ignition and spread.  6. **Forecast Temperature:** The forecast temperature map shows moderate to warm temperatures. While not extremely high, warmer temperatures combined with low humidity and lack of precipitation contribute to drying.   7. **Forecast Wind:**  The wind speed map shows moderate wind speeds. Wind can be a double-edged sword. While high winds can exacerbate fire behavior, moderate wind can also dry out fuels, increasing their flammability. The wind direction information is less critical in this scenario without existing fires.  **Conclusion:** Although there are no active fires currently, the forecast indicates a continued period of dry conditions with low precipitation, low humidity, and moderate temperatures. This combination significantly increases the risk of new fire starts if an ignition source is present. However, without information about potential ignition sources, it's impossible to definitively say a new fire WILL occur. "

Here's my reasoning:  * **Current Fire Size:** The ""current active fires"" image shows a very small number of fire pixels, indicating a small, contained fire.  * **Recent Detections:** The yellow color of the fire pixels suggests these detections are very recent.   * **Lack of Information:** We don't have information on wind speed or direction, which are crucial for fire spread. However, given the very small size and recent detection, even with moderate wind, it's unlikely the fire would grow significantly larger in just one day.   **Therefore, based on the limited information and assuming no drastic changes in wind conditions, the most likely scenario is a smaller active fire the next day, potentially even complete extinguishment.** ","**Larger Active Fire**  Here's the reasoning:  1. **Active Fire Presence:** The ""current active fires"" image shows several fire pixels, indicating an ongoing fire.   2. **Wind Speed:** The ""forecast wind speed"" image shows predominantly green and yellow hues, representing moderate to high wind speeds. High winds can quickly spread wildfires.  3. **Limited Precipitation:** The ""forecast total precipitation"" image displays mostly dark purple, indicating little to no rain. Without rainfall to dampen fuels, the fire will likely continue to burn.  4. **Dry Conditions:** The ""forecast specific humidity"" image shows a mix of colors, but not overwhelmingly towards the very low end. This suggests somewhat dry conditions, which could contribute to fire growth.  5. **Temperature:** The ""forecast temperature"" image reveals generally blue and green colors, signifying moderate temperatures. While not extremely high, these temperatures are unlikely to significantly inhibit fire spread, especially with the wind.  **Conclusion:**  Considering the presence of active fire, moderate to high wind speeds, minimal anticipated rainfall, and relatively dry conditions, the fire is likely to spread and become larger.

Here's a breakdown:  * **No Current Fires:** The ""current active fires"" image shows no active fires within the area. This is our baseline. * **Fuel and Moisture:** Images like NDVI, EVI2, and PDSI provide information about fuel availability (vegetation) and moisture levels. These factors contribute to fire risk but don't inherently mean a fire will start.  * **ERC:** The Energy Release Component (ERC) indicates potential fire intensity *if* a fire were to occur. A high ERC doesn't automatically translate to a fire ignition. * **Missing Ignition Source:**  Crucially, what's missing is information about potential ignition sources. Wildfires typically require a trigger, such as:     * **Lightning:**  We have no weather data indicating lightning storms.     * **Human Activity:** The images don't reveal if there's human activity in the area that could accidentally or intentionally spark a fire.   **In Conclusion:**  Without evidence of an imminent ignition source (like lightning or human activity) coupled with the absence of current fires, it's reasonable to predict ""No New Active Fire.""   **Important Note:** Wildfire prediction is complex. This assessment is based solely on the provided images and their descriptions. Real-world fire prediction relies on much more extensive data, including weather forecasts, real-time fire behavior models, and on-the-ground observations. ","No New Active Fire  Here's why:  * **No Current Fires:** The most important image is the ""current active fires"" map, which shows no active burning. This means there's no immediate fire to spread. * **Wind Is Not a Decisive Factor:** While wind speed and direction are important for fire spread, they don't inherently cause fires. Without an existing ignition source, wind alone is unlikely to start a new fire. * **Lack of Precipitation Is a Concern:** The complete absence of precipitation (total precipitation map is all purple) suggests very dry conditions. This makes the area more susceptible to fire if an ignition source were to be present.  * **Temperature is Moderate:**  While the maximum temperature map shows some warmer areas, it's not at an extreme level that would guarantee new fire starts.  **In Conclusion:**  Without any currently active fires and with moderate temperatures, it's unlikely a new wildfire will start in the next day, even though the area is dry. However, the lack of precipitation indicates a high risk if any ignition sources were to be introduced (e.g., lightning, human activity). ","No New Active Fire  **Reasoning:**  While the images provide information about terrain and current fire status, they lack crucial factors for predicting new wildfire ignitions.   Here's why:  * **Missing Weather Data:** Wildfire risk significantly depends on weather conditions like temperature, humidity, wind speed, and lightning.  These images don't provide any of that information. * **No Fuel Data:**  The type and dryness of vegetation (fuel) are critical. Dry, easily flammable fuels greatly increase wildfire risk. This information is absent. * **No Ignition Source:** Wildfires require an ignition source, most commonly lightning strikes or human activity. These images don't indicate any existing fires or potential ignition sources.  **In Summary:** Predicting new wildfire ignitions requires more than just terrain data.  Weather, fuel conditions, and potential ignition sources are all essential for accurate wildfire forecasting. ","No New Active Fire  **Reasoning:**  1. **No current active fires:** The ""current active fires"" image is entirely purple, indicating no existing fires in the area.    2. **Moderate temperature:** While the ""forecast temperature"" image shows some warmer areas (yellowish), the overall temperature range (14.46°C to 16.51°C) is not drastically high. This suggests a moderate temperature forecast, which alone is unlikely to spontaneously spark a wildfire.  3. **Wind conditions:** The ""forecast wind speed"" image indicates moderate wind speeds.  While wind can contribute to fire spread, moderate wind without an existing ignition source is unlikely to cause a new fire.  4. **Crucially, no indication of ignition:** None of the images provide information about potential ignition sources, which are essential for a wildfire to start.  Wildfires require a trigger, such as lightning, human activity (campfires, arson, etc.), or even machinery sparks.   **In conclusion:**  Without any existing fires or indications of potential ignition sources, even with moderate wind and temperature, it's unlikely a new wildfire will start within the next day.

Here's why:  * **Current Active Fires:** The ""current active fires"" image shows a very small cluster of fire pixels. This indicates a fire in its early stages. * **VIIRS Band M11:**  This band detects heat. While the current fire appears small, the M11 image shows a larger area of elevated temperature values (yellows and greens) around the actively burning pixels. This suggests a significant heat presence in the vicinity, indicating potential for spread.  * **Fuel Availability (NDVI and EVI2):** The NDVI and EVI2 images show healthy vegetation (high values, represented by yellows and greens) surrounding the fire area.  While this vegetation might not be currently burning, it represents potential fuel if the fire continues to spread. * **Drought Conditions (PDSI):** The PDSI image indicates moderate drought conditions (negative values) in the area. Drought-stressed vegetation is more flammable and aids fire spread.  **In summary:**  While the active fire appears small currently, the presence of surrounding heat, available fuel in the form of vegetation, and drought conditions strongly suggest the fire will likely grow larger the next day. ","Smaller Active Fire.   Here's my reasoning:  * **Active Fire Presence:**  While the current active fire pixels are bright (indicating recent detection), they cover a very small area. This suggests a very new fire. * **Precipitation:** The total precipitation image shows some precipitation (greenish-yellow) in the vicinity of the active fire. While not heavy rainfall, any precipitation can help dampen fuels and potentially slow the fire's growth.  * **Other Factors:**  While wind speed is a factor in fire spread, the specific direction of the wind will determine if it pushes the fire toward more fuel or away from it. We don't have enough information from the wind direction image alone to determine this. Temperature is also a factor, but the values shown are not extreme enough to suggest a dramatic increase in fire activity overnight.  **In conclusion:** Given the very small size of the current fire, coupled with the presence of some precipitation, it's most likely the fire will be smaller or completely extinguished by the next day. ","Similar Active Fire   **Reasoning:**  * **Current Active Fires:** The image shows a very small, concentrated fire with a few yellow pixels (recent detections).  * **Slope:**  The slope in the area appears to have some moderate areas (greenish-yellow), but overall, a significant portion is purple/blue, indicating flatter terrain. * **Missing Information:** We lack critical data on wind conditions and fuel availability.    **Considering the evidence:**  * **Limited Growth Potential:** The very small size of the current fire suggests limited immediate growth potential, even with moderate slopes.   * **Slope Not Highly Conducive:** While moderate slopes can accelerate fires, they are not as significant a factor as steep slopes. The fire might spread slowly in those areas. * **Unknown Factors:** Wind is a primary driver of fire spread. Without wind information, it's impossible to determine how quickly the fire could grow. Similarly, fuel type and density are crucial.   **Conclusion:** Given the very limited fire size and the lack of information about wind and fuel, the most likely scenario is that the fire will remain **similar in size** on the next day.  However, this is highly uncertain. Even a slight change in wind could drastically alter the fire's behavior. ","Larger Active Fire  **Reasoning:**  1. **Active Fire Presence:**  The current active fires image shows a concentrated cluster of fire pixels. This indicates an ongoing and potentially developing wildfire situation.  2. **Wind Speed:** The forecast wind speed image displays predominantly green and yellow hues, suggesting moderate to high wind speeds.  Strong winds can rapidly spread embers and flames, leading to fire growth.  3. **Wind Direction:**  While the wind direction is variable (as seen in the image), the presence of strong winds makes the direction significant. Even if winds shift, the higher speeds are likely to push the fire, potentially expanding its perimeter.  4. **Lack of Precipitation:**  The forecast total precipitation image is entirely purple, meaning no rain is predicted. Without rainfall to dampen fuels and moderate fire behavior, the existing fire will likely continue to burn readily.  5. **Temperature and Humidity:** The forecast temperature image shows relatively warm temperatures (greens and yellows), while the specific humidity image is mostly greens and blues, indicating moderate humidity levels. These conditions, combined with the lack of precipitation, will contribute to ongoing dry fuel conditions, favoring fire growth.  **Conclusion:**  Given the existing fire activity, the prediction of strong winds, no rain, and warm temperatures, it's highly probable the fire will be larger the next day.

This indicates a very recently ignited or small fire. 2. **VIIRS Band M11:** The M11 image, which highlights thermal anomalies, shows a broader area of elevated temperatures (greens and yellows) surrounding the tiny active fire area. This suggests a significant heat source, likely smoldering vegetation or ground fire, which isn't yet fully flaming.  3. **Fuel Availability (NDVI, EVI2):** Both NDVI and EVI2 show generally healthy vegetation (greens and yellows) in the vicinity of the active fire. This means there's ample fuel available if the fire spreads. 4. **Drought (PDSI):**  The PDSI indicates a moderate to severe drought (mostly yellows and greens).  Drought conditions dry out fuels, making them more receptive to ignition and supporting fire spread.  **Conclusion:**  While the current active fire is small, the presence of significant heat in the surrounding area (M11), the availability of fuel (NDVI, EVI2), and the drought conditions (PDSI) strongly suggest that the fire will likely spread and become larger the next day. ","Larger Active Fire  **Reasoning:**  * **No Precipitation:** The total precipitation image is entirely purple, indicating no rain is forecasted. This implies dry conditions will persist, favoring fire growth.  * **Wind Conditions:**  The wind speed image shows relatively high wind speeds (yellows and greens), which can quickly spread a fire.  While not as critical, the lack of a single dominant wind direction could also contribute to spreading in multiple directions. * **Current Fire:**  Although the current active fire image shows a very small fire, the conditions are ripe for it to grow.   **In summary:** The combination of no predicted rainfall, relatively high wind speeds, and existing (even if small) active fire strongly suggests the fire will likely be larger the next day. ","Larger Active Fire   **Reasoning:**  * **Limited Information:**  We only see a single active fire pixel in the ""current active fires"" image. This makes it difficult to definitively say whether the fire will grow or shrink.   * **Early Stage:** A single pixel suggests the fire is likely very small and potentially just starting.  * **Propensity to Grow:**  Fires, especially in their early stages, have a natural tendency to spread if conditions are favorable (fuel, weather, topography).    **Without more information on:**  * **Weather:** Wind speed and direction are crucial for fire spread. * **Fuel:** Type and dryness of vegetation significantly impact a fire's ability to grow.   **It's more likely the fire will grow at least slightly larger than its current single-pixel size.** ","Larger Active Fire  **Reasoning:**  1. **Current Fire:** We see a single, small active fire pixel. This suggests a very recent ignition or a small fire.  2. **Wind Speed:** The forecast shows high wind speeds (yellowish colors) in the area. High wind speeds significantly increase fire spread and intensity.   3. **Wind Direction:** While not crucial for this scenario, the wind direction appears relatively consistent (similar colors), suggesting the fire will spread in a somewhat predictable direction, rather than being dispersed erratically.  4. **Precipitation:** There is minimal to no predicted precipitation (mostly purple with a small area of slightly greenish). Dry conditions, coupled with high wind, will further exacerbate fire spread.  5. **Humidity and Temperature:** Moderate humidity and relatively high temperatures (greenish-yellow for both) further contribute to favorable fire conditions.  **Conclusion:**  Considering the combination of a small existing fire with a forecast of high wind speeds and dry conditions, it's highly likely the fire will grow significantly. Therefore, the prediction is **Larger Active Fire**. "

This confirms the presence of significant heat sources.  3. **Fuel Availability:**       * **NDVI/EVI2:** The NDVI and EVI2 images show moderate to high values (greens/yellows) surrounding the active fire area. This suggests the presence of healthy vegetation that could act as potential fuel.     * **Landcover Class:** The landcover class map indicates the presence of vegetated areas (forests, shrublands) in proximity to the fire, further supporting the availability of fuel.  4. **Drought Conditions (PDSI):** The PDSI image shows negative values (purples/blues) in and around the fire area, indicating drought conditions. Dry vegetation ignites and burns more easily, increasing the likelihood of fire spread.  5. **Energy Release Component (ERC):** The ERC image displays moderately high values (greens/yellows) near the active fire, suggesting the potential for intense burning and energy release if the fire spreads to those areas.  **Conclusion:**  The combination of an active fire, available fuel in the surrounding areas, drought conditions, and the potential for intense burning based on ERC values strongly suggests that the fire is likely to grow larger on the next day. ","Larger Active Fire  Here's my reasoning:  * **No Precipitation:** The total precipitation image is entirely purple, indicating no rain is forecasted. This means the fire will not be dampened and will likely spread more easily. * **Relatively Low Specific Humidity:** The specific humidity image shows a mix of greenish and yellowish hues, suggesting the air will be relatively dry.  Dry air allows fuels to dry out further, increasing their flammability and promoting fire spread.  * **High Wind Speeds:** The wind speed image is mostly green and yellow, especially around the existing fire area. This indicates strong winds that can quickly spread the fire, carrying embers to ignite new areas. * **Wind Direction:** While not conclusive, the wind direction image suggests winds may be blowing in a direction that could push the fire towards areas with less existing fire (more purple areas).  **In summary:** The combination of no precipitation, relatively low humidity, and high wind speeds all point to conditions that are highly conducive to fire growth.

Fires tend to spread faster uphill, so even moderate slopes could contribute to growth.  3. **Lack of Strong Indicators for Decrease:** There's nothing in the aspect or elevation images to suggest conditions that would strongly favor a decrease in fire size.  **Conclusion:** Given the fire's very small starting point and the potential for uphill spread on moderate slopes, it is more likely the fire will grow to some degree rather than shrink or stay the same size.
