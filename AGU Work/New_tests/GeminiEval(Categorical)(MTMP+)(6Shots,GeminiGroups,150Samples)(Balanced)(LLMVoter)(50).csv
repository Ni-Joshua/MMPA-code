However, it does not suggest extremely high risk. * **PDSI:** The forecast for the following day shows a moderate PDSI value, indicating moderate drought conditions, which could increase fire risk but does not suggest extremely high risk. * **Landcover Class:** The forecast for the following day shows a mix of landcover types with moderate fuel characteristics. * **Active Fires:** The current active fire data shows no active fires.  The overall analysis suggests that the fire risk for the following day is moderate, with no active fires detected in the area. The moderate indicators suggest a potential for a wildfire, but it is not a certainty. Therefore, it is predicted that there will be no new active fire.","New Active Fire  The forecast shows no precipitation and relatively low specific humidity. This indicates dry conditions, which can increase the risk of fire ignition.  The maximum temperature is predicted to be high, which will further dry out vegetation and fuels. Additionally, the wind speed is predicted to be moderate, which can help spread a fire.  Therefore, the likelihood of a new active fire on the next day is high.","No New Active Fire. The images show that there are currently no active fires. The forecast variables, including slope, aspect, and elevation, do not indicate any specific conditions that would significantly increase the risk of a new wildfire starting in the next day. Therefore, based on the information provided, there is no indication of a new active fire the next day.","New Active Fire   The forecast shows relatively dry conditions, low humidity, and low precipitation, which can increase fire risk. The wind speed is moderate to high, which can increase fire intensity and spread, as well as making suppression efforts more challenging. The temperature is forecast to be moderate, which is not ideal but not a primary factor. These conditions together indicate that there is a risk of a new wildfire starting on the next day."
