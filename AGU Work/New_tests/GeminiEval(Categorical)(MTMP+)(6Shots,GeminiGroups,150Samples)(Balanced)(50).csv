The fire is decreasing in size, and there is no rainfall predicted. The wind direction is not conducive to spreading the fire further as the fire is not moving towards a new area.

Additionally, the vegetation is showing signs of stress, as shown by the NDVI and EVI2, suggesting that fuel is available, and the landcover is mostly forest and shrublands, which are fire-prone.

This will contribute to fire spread and potential for larger fire size.  * **Specific humidity:** The specific humidity is predicted to be lower, which means drier air. This indicates a lack of moisture, allowing fuels to dry out faster, contributing to larger fire size. * **Precipitation:**  No precipitation is predicted, indicating that there is no opportunity for moisture to reduce fire intensity.

Therefore, we can conclude that there will be a smaller active fire on the next day.","Similar Active Fire   The forecast shows that the wind speed is predicted to be low, which means the fire will not spread rapidly. The forecast also shows that there is no precipitation, which means the fire will not be suppressed by rain. The temperature is predicted to be moderate, which means it will not be hot enough to cause the fire to spread rapidly. Overall, the forecast conditions suggest that the fire will remain similar in size to the current day."

While there are no currently active fires, the yellow areas in VIIRS band M11 suggest a heightened risk of ignition.   Additionally, the Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) shows a mostly yellow color, indicating drought conditions in the area. Drought conditions contribute significantly to wildfire risk, making the area more susceptible to ignition.   Therefore, considering the potential thermal anomalies and the dry conditions, a new active fire is likely to occur.","New Active Fire  The forecast for the next day shows a low chance of precipitation (0.0) and low specific humidity (0.00183 to 0.00288), indicating dry conditions which could contribute to fire risk. The forecast for wind speed (2.0 to 4.5) is moderate, which can spread fire, but not rapidly. The forecast for minimum temperature (272.2 to 287.4) and maximum temperature (286.2 to 299.8) are both relatively high. In these circumstances, a new active fire is likely, though not large.","New Active Fire  The terrain is moderately sloped, with a south-facing aspect. This combination suggests a higher risk of fire ignition and spread due to increased sunlight and drier conditions. The elevation is relatively high, which generally indicates cooler temperatures but could also contribute to dry vegetation if the area is exposed to wind.  These factors together make it more likely for a new wildfire to start on the next day. ","New Active Fire.  The images show that there are no active fires, but the predicted wind speed is fairly high, the specific humidity is low, and the forecast temperature is mild. These conditions, especially the low humidity and high wind speed, are conducive to fire ignition and spread, increasing the risk of a new wildfire. Therefore, the likelihood of a new fire is relatively high. "
