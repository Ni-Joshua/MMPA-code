While warmer nights can contribute to increased fire activity, it's not a dominant factor in determining overall fire size. - The maximum temperature on the following day is also predicted to be slightly higher than the current day, indicating a hotter environment. Higher temperatures can dry out fuels and contribute to fire spread, but the difference in temperature isn't substantial enough to cause a significant change in fire size. - The forecast wind direction indicates a shift in wind direction, which can influence fire spread direction but not necessarily size. - The forecast temperature shows a slight increase compared to the current day, which could contribute to increased fire activity and spread. However, it's not a major factor in predicting a significant change in fire size. - The current active fires image reveals a single fire point.  Given that most of the forecast variables show minimal changes compared to the current day, and the fire point is currently small, it's reasonable to predict that the fire on the next day will be similar in size to the current day.
