Looking at the predicted images, the area where the fire is located is not predicted to change much in the next day in terms of the variables influencing fire spread.  It is likely that the active fires will be contained or extinguish before they spread significantly. Thus, the active fire on the next day is predicted to be smaller compared to the current day.

Therefore, the forecast precipitation and the specific humidity is a more accurate indicator of the fire size, than the Palmer Drought Severity Index, since the Palmer Drought Severity Index reflects long-term moisture availability.  ","Larger Active Fire.  The slope image shows that the area around the fire is relatively steep, indicating that the fire may spread quickly uphill. The elevation image shows that the fire is located at a relatively low elevation, which suggests that it may be able to spread more easily than a fire at a higher elevation. The landcover class image shows that the area around the fire is mostly covered in forest, which means that there is a lot of fuel for the fire to burn.
