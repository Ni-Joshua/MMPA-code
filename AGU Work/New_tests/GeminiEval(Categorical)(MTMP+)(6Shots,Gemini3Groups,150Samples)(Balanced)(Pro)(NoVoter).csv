Here's why:  * **Wildfires are ignited by a complex interplay of factors:** While terrain influences fire behavior once a fire is started, it doesn't determine ignition.  Factors like weather (wind, temperature, humidity, lightning), fuel conditions (dryness, type of vegetation), and human activity (accidental or intentional ignition) play critical roles.  * **No Weather information:**  Weather is absolutely critical in wildfire prediction. Hot, dry, and windy conditions drastically increase fire risk, while rain or high humidity can mitigate it. * **No Fuel Information:** The type and condition of vegetation (fuel) is another major factor.  Drier fuels ignite more easily and burn more intensely.  **In short:** Without information about weather, fuel conditions, and potential ignition sources, it's impossible to reliably predict if a new wildfire will emerge, even in areas with terrain conducive to fire spread.
