The fire is decreasing in size, and there is no rainfall predicted. The wind direction is not conducive to spreading the fire further as the fire is not moving towards a new area.

Additionally, the vegetation is showing signs of stress, as shown by the NDVI and EVI2, suggesting that fuel is available, and the landcover is mostly forest and shrublands, which are fire-prone.

This will contribute to fire spread and potential for larger fire size.  * **Specific humidity:** The specific humidity is predicted to be lower, which means drier air. This indicates a lack of moisture, allowing fuels to dry out faster, contributing to larger fire size. * **Precipitation:**  No precipitation is predicted, indicating that there is no opportunity for moisture to reduce fire intensity.

Here's the reasoning: 1. **Active Fires:** The current active fire image shows a single pixel that is not purple, indicating an active fire. 2. **ERC:** The energy release component (ERC) map shows a yellow color, indicating a higher potential energy release. This suggests that the fire has the potential to be intense. 3. **Fuel Load:**  The VIIRS band I2 and EVI2 images suggest a moderate to high fuel load, as the areas show a mix of yellow and green, indicating a higher than average amount of vegetation. 4. **Drought Conditions:** The Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) image shows a yellow color, indicating a moderate drought. This means that the vegetation is likely dry and susceptible to burning. 5. **Land Cover:** The land cover map indicates that the area is primarily covered by forests and shrublands, which are common fuel sources for wildfires.   Taken together, these factors suggest that the existing active fire could persist and possibly spread to a smaller degree on the next day,  leading to a ""Smaller Active Fire"".
