The forecast for total precipitation is low, indicating that there will be little to no moisture to suppress the fire. Therefore, based on this information, the fire is likely to become larger.

This suggests a greater heat signature and a more active fire. - The ERC is also higher, indicating a greater potential energy release per unit area. This suggests a more intense fire. - While the PDSI is showing a slightly lower value (purple) which indicates less severe drought conditions, it is still in the negative range, suggesting dry fuels that can easily ignite. - The landcover class is showing a large area covered by grasses (green). This could mean that the fire has spread into an area with abundant fuel.   Therefore, based on the above information, the fire is likely to be larger on the next day.","Smaller Active Fire  Here's the reasoning:  - The current active fires are not predicted to receive precipitation.  - The forecast wind speed is predicted to be moderately strong, which may contribute to the spread of the fire. - The forecast temperature is predicted to be warm, and the forecast specific humidity is predicted to be low, creating dry and favorable conditions for the fire to continue burning. - Since there is no precipitation to reduce the fire's intensity, and the forecast suggests conducive conditions for burning, the fire will likely continue with a similar size. ","Larger Active Fire  The active fire image shows the fire spreading along a valley. The elevation image shows that this valley runs uphill, indicating the fire will spread uphill. Since the fire is moving uphill, it's likely to spread and increase in size.  It's impossible to say whether the fire will be much larger, slightly larger, or even just larger than the current day, but it will be larger than the current day based on the images."

The PDSI image also shows a very high level of drought in the area, indicating that there is plenty of dried-out fuel available to feed the fire. The landcover image shows that the fire is in a forest area, which also means that there is plenty of fuel available. While the fire is currently small, the combination of these factors suggests that it will likely continue to burn and possibly spread in the next day. ","Similar Active Fire   The forecast wind speed is predicted to be lower (purple) than the current day wind speed.  This suggests that the fire may not spread as quickly. The forecast temperature is slightly higher (yellow) than the current day temperature, but this might not have a significant effect on fire spread. The forecast total precipitation is 0 (purple). While there is no rain expected, the specific humidity is slightly higher (yellow) than the current day. This suggests that the air will be slightly more humid and potentially slow down the fire spread. Considering all these factors, we can predict that the fire on the next day will be similar to the current day.",Larger Active Fire   The fire is likely to grow larger due to the presence of multiple active fire pixels at present. The fire is likely to spread along steep slopes to new areas and possibly merge.

The current active fire area has several individual fires, but the size of these fires appear similar to the previous days.

Thus, it is reasonable to predict that the fire size will remain similar. ","Similar Active Fire.   We can see from the forecast wind speed that the predicted wind speed is relatively low, and the forecast wind direction shows that the wind will be blowing in a different direction compared to the current day. We can also see from the forecast precipitation that it is predicted to be similar to the current day, and the forecast specific humidity is slightly higher, suggesting that the air will be slightly more humid on the following day.

Therefore, the best prediction is that there will be a Smaller Active Fire the next day. ","Similar Active Fire  The wind speed and direction on the following day are similar to the current day and will not cause a significant spread of the fire. The temperature will also be similar on the following day, leading to a similar fire spread. Although the specific humidity is slightly lower, it is not enough to significantly dry out the fuel and cause a dramatic increase in fire size.  However, the precipitation on the following day is not expected to be significant, suggesting that the fire may continue to burn.  Therefore, the fire on the following day is likely to be a similar size to the current day. ","Larger Active Fire   The fire is in a mountainous area with a lot of steep slopes that are facing the south. Steeper slopes can result in faster-moving and more intense fires. The higher elevation and the aspect combined mean that the area will be dry and prone to fire spreading.  Therefore, it is very likely that the fire will spread to a larger area the following day. "

There is no predicted precipitation for the next day, and there is no change in the specific humidity. The wind speed and direction are slightly less, but not enough to substantially change the size of the fire. The temperature is also predicted to be a little warmer, which will increase fire danger.

","Similar Active Fire.   The forecast wind speed is a bit higher on the next day but this won't change the fire size drastically. The forecast wind direction shows the wind blowing in the same direction on the next day.

This is a good indication that the fire will remain similar in size. However, the forecast values in the PDSI indicate drought conditions and potential for fire risk.
