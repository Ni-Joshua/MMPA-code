The fire will likely continue to burn at a similar size.","Larger Active Fire  - The wind speed is predicted to be higher on the next day, which will increase the spread of the fire - The wind direction is predicted to remain relatively similar - The temperature is also predicted to be higher, which will dry out the fuels and increase fire intensity.  All of these factors suggest that the fire is likely to grow larger on the next day."

However, the images do not suggest the fire will get significantly larger, nor that it will get significantly smaller. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that the fire on the next day will be a similar size.","Larger Active Fire   The forecast shows no rain and lower humidity levels, which are conditions that make it easy for the fire to grow.","Smaller Active Fire  The fire is currently burning, and we have no information that suggests any factors that would cause it to completely extinguish.  However, the images show that the fire is decreasing in size. Therefore, it is likely that there will still be an active fire, but smaller than the current one. ","Smaller Active Fire.   The wind speed is slightly higher than the current day. The forecast wind direction shows it moving in a similar direction. The forecast temperature is higher than the current day and the minimum temperature is also higher.

Overall, the information suggests that the fire is decreasing in size and energy release which indicates that the fire will likely be smaller the next day.","Larger Active Fire  The forecast indicates dry conditions with no precipitation, low specific humidity, and the Palmer Drought Severity Index shows drought conditions, which all contribute to the increase of fire risk.  This indicates that the fire will most likely grow.","Larger Active Fire. The forecast for the following day shows the fire spreading towards the lower elevation. This area has a land cover class of a mix of grasslands, forests, and shrubs which is a good fuel source for a fire. Also, the terrain in this area has a moderate slope, which indicates the fire will spread more quickly uphill. Therefore, the fire on the next day will likely be larger.

The forecast specific humidity and total precipitation are low, indicating dry conditions, which is good for fire spread. As a result, the fire is likely to continue to burn, but it may be smaller in size. So, we predict that the fire will be smaller. ","Larger Active Fire.  The images show a single active fire, and the landcover class is predominantly comprised of Shrublands. The slope image is forecast to have higher values, which are more likely to increase fire activity. The aspect image shows a greater potential for south-facing slopes that are more likely to be drier and fire-prone. The elevation image is not useful in predicting fire size in this context.
