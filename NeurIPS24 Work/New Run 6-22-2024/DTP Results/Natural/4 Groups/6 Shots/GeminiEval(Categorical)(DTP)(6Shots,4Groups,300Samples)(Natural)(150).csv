The current active fires image shows no active fires on the day the images were captured. The forecast images show that the area is likely to have a lot of dry vegetation. However, there are no signs of active fires in the area. Therefore, it can be concluded that there will be no new wildfire in the following day.","New Active Fire.    The forecast for tomorrow shows a high specific humidity, but there is no precipitation. This combination can lead to dry fuel and a high risk of a new wildfire starting.  Furthermore, a high drought severity index shows a lack of moisture and supports the risk of new fire ignition.","No New Active Fire. The current active fire image shows that there is no active fire in the area. While there is a prediction of the area to be fire prone due to the landcover and elevation data, there is no active fire at the moment and there is a low chance for new fire to start.","No New Active Fire.  Reasoning: - The current active fires image shows no active fires on the current day. - The forecast wind speed, direction, and temperature images do not show high values, which are critical for fire ignition and spread.  Even though the forecast temperature image shows a relatively warm temperature, it does not reach a threshold to initiate a new fire, especially considering the other factors. The absence of current active fires and the overall lower values in the forecast wind and direction images suggest that the likelihood of a new wildfire is low. Therefore, the answer is ""No New Active Fire""."
