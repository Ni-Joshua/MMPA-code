Considering these factors, we can infer that the fire on the next day will be larger in size.",Similar Active Fire  The active fires from the current day are numerous and clustered in similar location to the active fires from the next day. The image for the next day has more white pixels compared to the current day.  The image for the next day appears to have more active fire areas. The color gradient on both images appears similar. The number of pixels with active fire in both images is similar so the size of the fire will be similar. ,"Larger Active Fire. The forecast wind speed is higher than current day. High wind speed can rapidly spread fires by carrying embers. The forecast temperature is higher than current day which can increase fire risk and intensity.  Thus, we can predict that the fire on the next day is larger in size compared to the current day."

The current active fires image shows that there are no active fires in the area and that no new fires are predicted for the next day.  The landcover class image shows a mix of forest and grassland. This means the area is at risk of a wildfire, but the lack of active fire pixels suggests that there is no immediate risk. The aspect image shows a mix of north-facing and south-facing slopes. This indicates a mix of moisture levels that would contribute to the spread of fire. The elevation image shows a variety of elevation levels, but there is no indication that it would increase the risk of wildfire. The slope image shows some areas with relatively steep slopes, which could contribute to the spread of a fire.

Although the forecast for wind speed is not as high, the forecast temperature is high, the maximum temperature is high and the minimum temperature is not low.
