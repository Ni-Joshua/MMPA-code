Dry vegetation is easily ignited and serves as fuel for the fire.  5. **Past Precipitation and Forecast:** The ""total precipitation"" image indicates very low precipitation, and the ""forecast total precipitation"" image shows very little precipitation. This suggests that the area has been dry and will likely remain dry, contributing to the wildfire's spread and increasing the likelihood of new ignitions.  **Conclusion:** Based on the current active fires, strong winds, dry and hot conditions, and the presence of dry vegetation, it's highly likely that there will be a new wildfire on the next day. The existing wildfire is likely to spread, and the dry conditions will create favorable circumstances for new ignitions. "

Even though the ERC is indicating a more intense fire, the weather conditions are not supporting that. The forecast for wind speed and direction do not indicate any increase in fire spread, and there is a forecast for precipitation. The current precipitation is minimal and is unlikely to extinguish the fire, but it is likely to slow down the spread and dampen the flames. In conclusion, the fire is likely to continue burning but at a smaller scale due to the minimal precipitation and lack of high wind speeds. "

Here's why:  1. **Active Fires:** While the current active fire map shows no fires currently burning, the lack of any recent active fires is a key indicator. The most recent fires were likely extinguished before the images were captured, but new fires are possible.  2. **Vegetation:** The NDVI and EVI2 images show areas of both high and low vegetation density. Areas of low vegetation density can indicate drought-stressed vegetation, which is more susceptible to burning.  While the EVI2 image also shows areas of high vegetation density, if they dry out, they can become fuel for potential fires.   3. **Fuel Load:**  The VIIRS band I2 image, which monitors vegetation health and stress, shows a few hotspots that suggest potential fuel load.  4. **Weather Conditions:** The forecast images provide critical insights:     * **Low Precipitation:**  The forecast total precipitation shows a low amount of rain predicted for the next day, indicating dry conditions that increase fire risk.     * **Wind:** The forecast wind speed suggests moderate winds, which can contribute to rapid fire spread, while the wind direction map indicates a potential direction of spread.      * **Temperature:** The forecast temperature indicates above-average temperatures, which can further dry out vegetation and increase fire danger.     * **Humidity:** The forecast specific humidity is relatively low, implying dry air that can exacerbate fire risk.  5. **Terrain:** The terrain maps reveal potential fire spread challenges.      * **Slope:**  The slope image indicates areas of moderate to steep slopes, which can accelerate fire spread uphill.     * **Elevation:** The elevation map shows a variety of elevations, which can influence microclimates and fire behavior.  In conclusion, while the lack of current active fires is positive, the combination of vegetation health, fuel load, and predicted weather conditions, along with terrain features, creates a situation where the risk of new active fires is high.

Increased wind speed can contribute to fire spread.  3. **Forecast Wind Direction**: The forecast wind direction indicates that the wind is expected to blow the fire in a particular direction, but the wind direction is not strong enough to rapidly spread the fire.  4. **Forecast Temperature**: The forecast temperature suggests a slight increase. While higher temperatures can increase fire risk, the increase in this case is not significant enough to cause a drastic change in the fire's size.  5. **Forecast Specific Humidity**:  The forecast specific humidity shows that the air will be slightly drier. This means that the fuel will dry out more quickly.  6. **Forecast Total Precipitation**: The forecast precipitation image indicates no precipitation. This means the fire will not be extinguished or dampened by rain.  7. **Landcover Class**: The landcover class indicates that the fire is burning in an area with vegetation that can fuel the fire.  8. **NDVI and EVI2**: The NDVI and EVI2 images are showing relatively high values in the area where the fire is burning. This suggests that there is plenty of fuel available, although the fuel is not necessarily dry due to the current active fire.   9. **VIIRS Bands**: VIIRS bands M11 and I2 are showing slightly higher values, which could mean the fire intensity is slightly increasing. However, the values are still within the normal range, indicating that it's not a massive increase in intensity.  Combining all these factors, the fire is likely to experience a slight increase in size due to the higher wind speed, drier fuel conditions, and potential increase in intensity. Therefore, the most appropriate prediction is **Smaller Active Fire**."

While there are no active fires in the 'current active fires' image, this is only for the current day. The image doesn't show if any fires started earlier and continued to burn. * **Fuel Load and Health:** The vegetation health indices (NDVI and EVI2) suggest a healthy vegetation cover, meaning abundant fuel for fire. * **Drought Conditions:** The Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) reveals moderate to severe drought conditions. This indicates dry fuels, increasing the risk of fire ignition. * **Weather:** The current weather conditions are conducive to fire ignition and spread. The minimum and maximum temperature are high, indicating dry weather. The specific humidity is low, indicating dry air.   * **Forecast:** The forecast for the next day indicates a continued dry spell, with low forecasted specific humidity, high forecasted temperatures, and low to no precipitation. This suggests that the area will remain vulnerable to fire.  * **Wind:** While the current wind speed is moderate, the forecasted wind speed indicates a potential increase.

We see from the images that the current active fire is close to a forest, where vegetation and dry fuel is available for fire to spread.  2. The forecast wind speed image shows a high wind speed in the area around the active fire. This indicates that the wind will be strong enough to carry embers and potentially spread the fire.  3. The forecast wind direction indicates that the wind is blowing from the direction of the active fire towards the forest. This means the fire is likely to spread towards the forest due to the wind. 4. There is almost no forecast precipitation and specific humidity in the area. This indicates that there is low chance of rain, which would help extinguish the fire. 5. The forecast temperature shows that the temperature will be high, which will further dry out the vegetation and fuel in the forest making it more susceptible to fire.

The ""current active fire"" image shows that there are some actively burning fires. Additionally, the forecast images show that the conditions are ripe for a new fire. The forecast wind speed shows that it will be windy, which can easily spread fire. The forecast wind direction shows that the wind will be moving in a direction that could potentially cause the existing fire to spread.   Also, although there is no rainfall, the area is dry, with no precipitation in the past, and is forecast to remain dry. This suggests that the fuel will likely remain dry, which could lead to a new fire. The forecast temperature, specific humidity, and elevation all indicate dry conditions.  All these conditions indicate a high risk of new fires, and a high risk that the current fire could spread. "

Reasoning:  * **Current Active Fires:** The ""current active fires"" image shows a couple of active fires on the current day, indicating that the fire is currently burning. * **Forecast Total Precipitation:** The ""forecast total precipitation"" image indicates very low precipitation, suggesting dry conditions. This implies that the fire might not be significantly suppressed by rain. * **Forecast Wind Speed:**  The ""forecast wind speed"" image indicates high wind speeds, which will likely fan the flames and help the fire spread. * **Forecast Wind Direction:** The ""forecast wind direction"" image reveals a consistent wind direction, suggesting the fire might spread in a particular direction. * **Forecast Temperature:** The ""forecast temperature"" image shows relatively high temperatures, contributing to increased fire intensity and dryness of fuels.  * **Forecast Specific Humidity:** The ""forecast specific humidity"" image indicates low specific humidity, suggesting dry air which can worsen fire conditions.  Considering these factors,  it's likely that the fire will be larger on the next day due to the combination of low precipitation, high wind speeds, high temperatures, and low specific humidity. However, we must remember this is based on the provided information, and factors like the specific fuel type, topography, and firefighting efforts can also influence fire size. "
