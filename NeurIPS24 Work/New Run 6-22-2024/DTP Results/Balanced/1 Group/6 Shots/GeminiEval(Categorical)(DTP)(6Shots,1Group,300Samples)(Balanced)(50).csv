The fact that the current active fires image only shows a very small number of fires indicates that the forest has not recently been disturbed by fire and therefore there is ample fuel available. It is likely that the conditions will be right for a new fire to start."

Wind speed plays a significant role in fire spread, with higher wind speeds generally resulting in larger fires. While the forecasted wind direction could potentially drive the fire in a new direction, the moderate wind speed does not indicate a likely significant change in the fire's size.  The forecasted precipitation is zero. This suggests dry conditions, which could favor fire spread. However, the current fire's size is already relatively small.  While the forecasted temperature is slightly higher, the impact on fire size may be limited in the absence of strong winds.  Therefore, considering these factors, it is likely that the fire will remain similar in size on the next day."

The current active fire is small and present as a single pixel in the image.  2. The predicted total precipitation is between 2.5 and 29.125, indicating a chance of rain. 3.  Even though the forecast temperature and specific humidity are showing a slight increase indicating drier and warmer conditions, the predicted total precipitation is high enough to potentially reduce fire risk.  4. Although there is an increase in wind speed with the wind direction blowing towards the active fire, the amount of precipitation is likely to be significant enough to offset this risk.   Considering the chance of precipitation and the low risk associated with the current active fire, we can conclude that the fire is likely to remain similar in size or potentially become smaller the next day.
