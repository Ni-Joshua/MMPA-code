The images show an active fire and the forecast shows a very high wind speed which can increase fire intensity and a higher maximum temperature that will dry out vegetation and fuels and increase the likelihood of ignition and fire spread. The forecast also shows a low humidity which means that there is a very low level of moisture in the air, which can also increase the risk of fire.  Thus, the fire can potentially increase in size in the next day. However, there is also a predicted amount of precipitation and wind direction that can help control the fire. Considering the potential increase in fire size, the prediction is a smaller active fire. "
