The current active fire pixels are yellow, meaning they are recent detections.  2. The forecast wind speed is relatively high, meaning it could push the fire further.  3. The forecast wind direction is slightly different than the current wind direction, which could change the path of the fire and cause the fire to spread more quickly. 4.
