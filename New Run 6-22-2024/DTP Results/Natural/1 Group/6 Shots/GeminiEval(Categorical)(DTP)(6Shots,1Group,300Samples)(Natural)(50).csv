It is likely that there will be a new fire tomorrow, although a smaller one compared to the current active fires.  The following information supports this prediction:   - There is a significant amount of fuel available. The values in the I2 band (near-infrared wavelengths) are mostly high, indicating a large amount of vegetation and potential fuel. - The forecast wind speed (yellow color in the image) is slightly higher than the current wind speed (purple).  This suggests the wind will pick up slightly, which can make fires more likely to ignite and spread.  - The forecast temperature (yellow color) is slightly higher than the current temperature (purple).  Higher temperatures can dry out vegetation and make it more susceptible to burning.  - The forecast total precipitation (yellow color) is slightly higher than the current precipitation (purple). The area has been very dry, but this does suggest there could be some precipitation in the next day, which could decrease the likelihood of a new fire but does not definitively make it impossible. - The forecast specific humidity (yellow color) is higher than the current specific humidity (purple), meaning the air will be slightly more humid.  Humid air can help to dampen down fuels and make them less susceptible to burning, but this is a small change compared to the other factors. - The current active fires are still burning.  This suggests that there is a good chance that a new fire could ignite in the area, especially with the slightly warmer temperatures and increased wind speed.

Here’s why:  The images show that the area is experiencing drought conditions, with a relatively high Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI), and has a high fuel load, as indicated by the EVI2 and I2 images. This suggests that there is a high likelihood of new fire ignition.  The forecast wind speed is also high, which is an indicator of faster fire spread.  While there is predicted precipitation, the amount of precipitation is likely not enough to significantly reduce the fire risk. Additionally, the high maximum temperatures in the forecast can further dry out the area, further increasing the fire risk. In the current active fires image, there is at least one active fire in the area. Therefore, the likelihood of new fires is high. "

Therefore, the fire could spread due to strong wind speed, and could increase in size in spite of no additional ignition.  Based on the forecast data, it is likely that the active fire will not be extinguished and will remain active with similar size."

This is a significant factor in fire ignition.   - **High temperatures:** The forecast temperature image shows high temperatures, increasing the risk of fuels drying out and becoming more susceptible to ignition.   - **High wind speed:** The forecast wind speed image shows high wind speeds, which can rapidly spread fires and make them more difficult to control.   - **Moderate energy release component:** The energy release component image shows a moderate potential for fire intensity, suggesting that any fire that starts could be significant.   - **Low specific humidity:**  The forecast specific humidity image indicates dry air, further contributing to the risk of fire ignition and spread.  These factors combined create a high risk for new wildfire ignition.  However, it is important to note that the exact location and size of any potential new fires cannot be predicted from these images alone. "

The current active fires image shows no fires. The total precipitation, forecast total precipitation, forecast wind speed and forecast temperature all indicate some level of moisture and less extreme conditions which will likely reduce fire risk.

Considering these factors, the fire may not increase significantly, but there may be a chance of new ignition points and spread to nearby areas.
