It is likely that there will be a new fire tomorrow, although a smaller one compared to the current active fires.  The following information supports this prediction:   - There is a significant amount of fuel available. The values in the I2 band (near-infrared wavelengths) are mostly high, indicating a large amount of vegetation and potential fuel. - The forecast wind speed (yellow color in the image) is slightly higher than the current wind speed (purple).  This suggests the wind will pick up slightly, which can make fires more likely to ignite and spread.  - The forecast temperature (yellow color) is slightly higher than the current temperature (purple).  Higher temperatures can dry out vegetation and make it more susceptible to burning.  - The forecast total precipitation (yellow color) is slightly higher than the current precipitation (purple). The area has been very dry, but this does suggest there could be some precipitation in the next day, which could decrease the likelihood of a new fire but does not definitively make it impossible. - The forecast specific humidity (yellow color) is higher than the current specific humidity (purple), meaning the air will be slightly more humid.  Humid air can help to dampen down fuels and make them less susceptible to burning, but this is a small change compared to the other factors. - The current active fires are still burning.  This suggests that there is a good chance that a new fire could ignite in the area, especially with the slightly warmer temperatures and increased wind speed.
