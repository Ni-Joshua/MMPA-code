High wind speeds can rapidly spread fires by carrying embers and increasing the rate of fire movement.  * **Forecast Temperature:** The forecast temperature image shows that the area with the active fires is expected to experience higher temperatures. This could dry out fuels and increase fire intensity, leading to larger fires. * **Forecast Specific Humidity:** The forecast specific humidity image indicates a lower specific humidity in the area, indicating dry air and conditions that are conducive to fire spread.  * **Current Active Fires:** The current active fires image shows several fire points with recent detection times. This suggests that the fires are actively burning and have the potential to spread.  * **Land Cover Class:** The land cover image shows areas of evergreen forests and shrublands, which are highly susceptible to fire. * **Other Factors:** While the lack of precipitation, coupled with the already dry conditions, does not help the fire situation, the presence of some vegetation and the wind speed are the key factors for the prediction.  Combining these factors, it suggests that the fire is likely to be larger on the next day due to the combined effects of high wind speeds, increased temperatures, dry air, and suitable fuel conditions.
