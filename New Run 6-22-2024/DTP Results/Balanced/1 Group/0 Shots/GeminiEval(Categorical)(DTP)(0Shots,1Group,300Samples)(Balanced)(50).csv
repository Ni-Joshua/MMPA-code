The current active fires image shows no active fires at the moment. However, we need to consider the conditions that might lead to new fires. 2. The forecast total precipitation image shows low precipitation values, indicating a dry environment. Dry conditions increase the risk of fire ignition. 3. The forecast wind speed image shows a higher wind speed in the yellow areas, which could rapidly spread embers and increase the chances of new fires. 4. The forecast wind direction image reveals a direction that could potentially carry embers towards areas with suitable fuel. 5. The forecast temperature image shows warm temperatures, which can further dry out vegetation and increase fuel flammability. 6. The forecast specific humidity image indicates low humidity, which is a key factor in fire ignition as it dries out fuels. 7. The NDVI and EVI2 images show a presence of green vegetation, which can serve as fuel.  Therefore, considering the dry conditions, high wind speed, favorable wind direction, warm temperatures, low humidity, and the presence of fuel, it's highly likely that a new wildfire might occur in the next day.

Here's the reasoning:  * **Current Active Fires**:  The image shows a few active fires, indicated by the yellow pixels. * **Forecast Wind Speed**: The forecast wind speed is shown to be significantly higher than the current wind speed. Strong winds are a key factor in fire spread. * **Forecast Wind Direction**: The forecast wind direction suggests that the wind will blow towards the areas with active fires. * **Forecast Temperature**: The forecast temperature is higher than the current temperature, which can further dry out fuels and make them more susceptible to ignition.  * **Forecast Precipitation**: The forecast precipitation is extremely low. This implies that the area will remain dry, providing favorable conditions for fire spread. * **Forecast Specific Humidity**: The forecast specific humidity is also low, indicating that the air will be dry, further contributing to fire intensification.  Based on the above, the combination of strong winds, higher temperatures, low humidity, and a lack of rainfall all point towards an increased risk of fire spread, suggesting that the fire is likely to be larger the next day.
