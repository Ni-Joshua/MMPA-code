","Larger Active Fire  The current active fire has a few smaller yellow dots and a large yellow dot which represents a recent detection time.  However, the next day, the yellow dots are brighter, indicating a more recent time, and more yellow dots can be seen. This suggests that the fire will likely be larger in the next day.","Similar Active Fire.   The forecast wind speed and direction are similar to the current day, and the forecast temperature is slightly higher. This indicates that the fire may continue to burn at a similar rate, potentially spreading slightly more due to the higher temperature.   However, there are no significant changes in wind speed or direction that would suggest a dramatic increase in fire size. Therefore, the fire is likely to remain similar in size. "

The forecast variables also indicate that there will be an active fire on the next day.   The VIIRS band M11 image shows a high level of thermal anomalies, indicating a high probability of active fires.   The VIIRS band I2 and I1 images show a high level of vegetation stress, indicating a high probability of drought conditions, which can increase the likelihood of a fire starting.   The ERC image indicates high potential energy release per unit area, also indicating a high likelihood of a fire starting and spreading.   Based on these variables, it is highly likely that a new fire will start on the next day, especially if there is no rain or other mitigating factors.","No New Active Fire. There are no currently active fires and the forecast shows a decent amount of precipitation, so it is unlikely a new wildfire will start on the next day. ",New Active Fire  The current active fires indicate that the area is already experiencing fire activity. There are no factors to suggest that the fire will not spread in the next day. This suggests that the fire activity will continue and likely expand in the next day. ,"New Active Fire.  The forecast wind speed is yellow, indicating a larger wind speed, which can lead to the spreading of fires. The minimum temperature is also yellow, indicating a higher temperature which can increase the risk of fires. Even though the current active fire is purple, indicating no active fires in the area, the forecast suggests an active fire may start soon."

The forecast does not show any precipitation, so the fire has a chance to grow. The forecast shows that the specific humidity will be lower, so the air is expected to be drier. Dry air means the fire has more fuel available to burn.  The active fires image shows that the fire is getting bigger.  The combination of these factors makes it likely that the fire will be bigger on the next day.","Larger Active Fire.   The information provided only allows a prediction based on current fire activity. The images show multiple active fire pixels, indicating that the fire is already burning, and the forecast variables are not provided to determine how the fire would spread. As the information provided does not include the forecast for wind speed, humidity, or other variables that could help predict fire behavior, it is impossible to say whether the fire will be larger, smaller, or similar in size. It is only possible to infer from the current active fires that the fire is active and could potentially grow larger based on current conditions.","Larger Active Fire. The current active fires are small and isolated.  The forecast wind speed is predicted to increase, and the forecast temperature is increasing as well. Increased wind speed and higher temperatures will likely result in an increase in fire size. "
