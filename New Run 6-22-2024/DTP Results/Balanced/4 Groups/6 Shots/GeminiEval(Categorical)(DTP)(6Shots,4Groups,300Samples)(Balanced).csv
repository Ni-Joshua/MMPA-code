The active fire map shows that the fire is burning in a few locations.  2. The slope map shows a steep incline in the terrain.  3. The elevation map shows high elevations in the area.  4. The land cover map shows that there is a mix of vegetation, including forest and grasslands.  With these factors, it is likely that the fire will spread. This is because steeper slopes can result in faster-moving and more intense fires, high elevations can contribute to drier conditions, and a mix of vegetation provides fuel for the fire to spread.

The images show that there has been an active fire on the current day, and that the fire will remain active for the next day. There is no indication of the fire getting larger or smaller from the images. ","Larger Active Fire   The forecast precipitation is predicted to be 0.0, indicating dry conditions.  Also, the forecast specific humidity is low.  Low specific humidity indicates dry air and can dry out fuels, which increases fire risk. Therefore, the fire is likely to be larger on the next day.","Larger Active Fire   The current fire is fairly small. However, the area is quite steep and the landcover suggests that there is plenty of fuel to burn. Thus, the fire is likely to spread to a larger size.","Larger Active Fire   The forecast wind speed is higher, meaning the wind will be stronger on the next day. Wind is a critical factor in the spread of wildfires. Higher wind speed can rapidly spread fires by carrying embers and increasing the rate of fire movement. Also, the forecast temperature is higher, which means the area will be hotter on the next day. This can dry out vegetation and fuels, increasing the likelihood of ignition and fire spread.  All of this information suggests that the fire on the next day is likely to be larger than the current day's fire."

Even though the conditions are dry and could lead to an increase in the fire size, there is no information given on the fire spreading or the activity increasing, and the current active fire size is small. Therefore, the active fire is likely to remain similar in size.","Similar Active Fire. The active fires are located in areas with low slope, low elevation, and a mixed land cover, which are not conducive to rapid fire spread. Therefore, it is likely that the size of the fire will remain similar.","Similar Active Fire   The forecast wind speed is not very high and the forecast temperature is not extremely high either, so the fire will likely not spread significantly. The wind direction is not pointing towards any major fuel source, so the fire will probably remain in the same place.  "

The forecast M11 band shows an increase in values compared to the current day. Since M11 band is sensitive to thermal anomalies, higher values indicate more active fires and hot spots. This suggests that the fire could spread and potentially grow larger the following day. ","Smaller Active Fire  The images show that the current active fires are widespread. The forecast shows that the following day will be dry and have low humidity with no precipitation. These conditions will help contain the fires. In addition, the forecast specific humidity is low, indicating dry air, which will limit fire spread. The forecast total precipitation is zero, indicating a lack of moisture that will help suppress the fires. Thus, the fire on the next day is likely to be smaller.","Larger Active Fire   The images show a relatively large active fire area. Because the forecast shows an increase in elevation and a slight increase in the steepness of the slopes, it is likely that the fire will grow in size due to the more favorable environmental conditions for the fire to spread. It is important to note that these predictions are based on the images and may not be entirely accurate because they do not consider weather conditions, which play a crucial role in wildfire behavior.","Similar Active Fire  The forecast wind speed is low, and the forecast wind direction is not consistently in any one direction. The minimum temperature is not very high, and the maximum temperature is only slightly higher than the minimum temperature. All of these indicate that the fire will likely not be able to grow too rapidly. The current active fire image shows multiple fires that do not seem to be expanding rapidly, so we can likely say that the fire will be similar in size on the next day."

The forecast images show a decrease in the thermal anomalies (M11), a decrease in the potential energy release (ERC), and a decrease in the area of recent active fire detections.

The forecast total precipitation is very low, suggesting dry conditions. The forecast specific humidity is also very low, indicating dry air, which could fuel the fire.

","Smaller Active Fire  The forecast for the next day shows no precipitation and low specific humidity, which indicates dry conditions. Dry conditions can contribute to the spread of fire, but the specific humidity and PDSI values are not extremely low. Therefore, the fire could potentially be smaller the next day. ","Larger Active Fire.  The fire is spreading and is likely to be larger the next day. This is because the current fire is in an area with higher elevation, as shown in the elevation map, which indicates a cooler and drier climate with potential for fire spread. Additionally, the landcover map shows that the fire is in an area with mixed forests, closed shrublands, and grasslands, which are all suitable fuel types for fire. This, combined with the slope information, which shows the fire is in a relatively steep area, suggests that the fire is likely to spread more quickly and become larger. The forecast variables further support the assumption of a larger fire because the elevation, aspect, and slope information suggest the fire is in an area that is conducive to rapid spread. ","Similar Active Fire  The predicted wind speed is slightly higher, but the wind direction is more similar, leading to a possible slight increase in size. The predicted temperature is also slightly higher, increasing the risk of fuel dryness and fire activity. However,  the actual size change is likely to be minor because the change in wind speed is small, and the current fire size is already large. Therefore, the fire on the next day is likely to be similar in size compared to the current day. "
