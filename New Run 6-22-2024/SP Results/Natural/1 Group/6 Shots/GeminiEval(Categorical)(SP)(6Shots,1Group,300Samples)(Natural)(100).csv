So, overall, it is expected that the active fire area will be smaller on the next day."

The forecast specific humidity is also predicted to be higher than the current day, suggesting more moisture in the air. The forecast temperature is also higher than the current day's temperature.  The combination of the higher precipitation and humidity, with a slight decrease in wind speed, and the higher temperature, suggests the fire will be smaller. "

The forecast wind speed is higher than current, and the forecast temperature is warmer.
