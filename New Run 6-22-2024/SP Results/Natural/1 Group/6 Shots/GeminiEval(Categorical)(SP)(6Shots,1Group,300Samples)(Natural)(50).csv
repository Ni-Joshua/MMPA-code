Although the forecast wind speed (yellow) and temperature (yellow) will be greater than they were the day of the images, the forecast total precipitation (yellow) and specific humidity (yellow) will be higher.  The higher precipitation and specific humidity mean a wetter environment that will suppress potential fires. There are no active fires at the time of the images.  The higher precipitation and specific humidity make it unlikely that new active fires will start. "

The wind speed, wind direction, and temperature are relatively similar compared to the previous day, and there is no increase in the maximum temperature.  There is a slight increase in the specific humidity, which means there is a small increase in the moisture in the air, but not enough to make a significant difference.  This suggests that the fire will remain at a similar size. "

The current active fire image shows one pixel is on fire.  The forecast specific humidity is slightly increasing, meaning the air will have slightly more moisture.
