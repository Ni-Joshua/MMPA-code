This suggests potential for dry fuels.  - **Total precipitation and forecast total precipitation:** Both images show no precipitation, indicating dry conditions.  - **Wind speed and forecast wind speed:** The images indicate moderate wind speeds, which could contribute to fire spread. - **Minimum and maximum temperature:** The images show moderately high temperatures, which could further dry out fuels.  Considering the above factors, the dry conditions, moderate wind speeds, and high temperatures suggest a higher risk of new fire ignition.   Therefore, the final answer is **New Active Fire**. "

However, the total precipitation image shows very little rainfall (almost entirely purple), suggesting dry conditions. The forecast precipitation image is also mostly purple, indicating no significant rain expected the next day.  Dry fuels are more susceptible to burning.  3. **Temperature and Humidity:** The forecast temperature image suggests warmer temperatures (yellow), and the forecast specific humidity image indicates lower humidity (purple), both factors that increase fire risk.  4. **Wind:** The wind speed and direction images show moderate wind speeds (yellow and green) and consistent direction, which can contribute to fire spread.  5. **Other Factors:** While the landcover image shows a mix of vegetation types, the elevation image indicates a relatively mountainous terrain, which can make firefighting more challenging. The PDSI image shows drought conditions (green and yellow), further increasing fire risk.  **Overall:**  The combination of factors like dry fuels, high temperatures, low humidity, moderate winds, and mountainous terrain suggests that fire conditions will likely remain conducive to burning, though perhaps with slightly reduced activity due to the lack of precipitation.

Here's the reasoning:  1. The current active fires image shows no active fires.  2. While the VIIRS band M11 image shows a small hot spot, the other images don't have corresponding high values, which indicates that the hot spot could be a false positive.  3. The forecast total precipitation shows a relatively high amount of precipitation for the next day.   4.  High precipitation typically reduces fire risk.   5.  Therefore, it is likely that there will be no new active fires the next day. "
