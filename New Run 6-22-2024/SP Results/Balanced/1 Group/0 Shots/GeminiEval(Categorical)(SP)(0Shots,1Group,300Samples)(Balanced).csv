Strong winds can rapidly spread fires.     * **Temperature:** Current temperatures are high, and the forecast predicts even higher temperatures. Hotter temperatures dry out fuels and make them more susceptible to ignition.     * **Humidity:** Current specific humidity is low, and the forecast predicts even lower specific humidity. Dry air further increases fire risk.     * **Precipitation:** No precipitation is expected for the following day, which means no moisture will be added to the area.  3. **Fuel Conditions:**  The NDVI and EVI2 images indicate areas of healthy vegetation. While these areas are less likely to ignite, they can serve as fuel if they dry out under the hot and dry conditions.  4. **Terrain:** The terrain is characterized by moderate elevation, moderate slopes, and a mix of aspects. This suggests that while the terrain may not significantly contribute to rapid fire spread, it's not a strong mitigating factor either.  **Overall:**  The combination of high wind, hot temperatures, low humidity, dry fuels, and no rain all suggest an increased risk of fire spread and intensified fire activity.
